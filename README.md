# ***Mindactivity App For Managing Stressüßò***

Welcome to Mindactivity!


Mindactivity (Mindfulness + Activity) is a meditative media app which allows users to time their meditation and deep work sessions. Here's a little demo of the app:

<br/>

*This documentation is for the entire Mindactivity app. If you're interested in the backend/API specifically, go to [my fork of the backend repository](https://github.com/AureaFlamma/Mindactivity_backend.git)*

<br/>

*This is a fork of the Mindactivity frontend repo. Original repos can be found here: [frontend](https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/w9_frontend-project-mindactivity.git) & [backend](https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/w9_backend-project-mindactivity). All links from this point onward point to the original repos.*

## ***Getting StartedüèÅ***


### **Backend** ###

**It is important to get the backend working before you run the frontend in order to use the affirmations and the blog post features*
1. Fork the original backend repository. You can find it [here](https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/w9_backend-project-mindactivity).
2. Clone the forked repo to your computer. Unless you renamed the repo whilst forking, the command is (insert your GitHub username where indicated): 
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/w9_backend-project-mindactivity
```
3. Install all the dependencies:
```bash
  npm i
```
3. Copy your database (e.g. Heroku) URL into the .env file, following the format:
```bash
 DATABASE_URL = <Database URL goes here>
```
4. Create the affirmations table in your database by running this script in the terminal:
```bash
npm run db:createAffirmationsTable
```
5. Populate the affrimations table you have just created with data from "/lib/affirmationData.js" by running this script in the terminal:
```
npm run db:populateAffirmationsTable
```
6. Now, repeat the last 2 steps for blog table. First create it...:
```bash
npm run db:createBlogTable
```
7. ...then populate it with data from "/lib/blogs.js":
```bash
db:populateBlogTable
```
8. Finally, run the server:
```bash
  npm run dev
```

### **Frontend** ###

1. For the original frontend repo. You can find it [here](https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/w9_backend-project-mindactivity)
2. Unless you have renamed the repo when you forked it, you can clone it with this command (insert your GitHub username where indicated)
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/w9_backend-project-mindactivity
```
3. Install the dependencies by running this command in the terminal.
